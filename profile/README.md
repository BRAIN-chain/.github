# BRAIN: Blockchain-based Reliable AI Network

Welcome to BRAIN, a pioneering Blockchain-based Reliable AI Network that aims to revolutionize the way AI models are trained and executed, ensuring transparency, reliability, and efficiency.

BRAIN offers a groundbreaking solution that enhances decentralized AI by merging AI with blockchain for secure, transparent, and scalable AI applications, overcoming challenges with large-scale models and ensuring high throughput and reliability even in the presence of Byzantine nodes.

### Main Features
- **Two-Phase Transaction Execution**: Enhances blockchain performance by allowing pipelining among inference/training transactions and regular transactions.
- **Asynchronous Aggregator-Free Federated Learning**: Implements an innovative asynchronous federated learning algorithm that does not require a central aggregator, ensuring privacy and scalability.
- **Scalable Verification**: Employs a verifiable randomly selected committee for scalable verification of inference and training processes, achieving consensus through smart contracts.
